# CrackDetection
- About this project
This repository contains the code for crack detection in asphalt surfaces. It is a c++, opencv implementation of the paper by Yuxiao Zhou:
[Seed-Based Approach for Automated Crack Detection from Pavement Images](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305792615_Seed-Based_Approach_for_Automated_Crack_Detection_from_Pavement_Images)"".

The proposed crack detection algorithm includes following steps:
